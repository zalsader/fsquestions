\begin{abstract}
  The virtual filesystem (VFS) is a key component of the Linux kernel, which allows programs to use standard Unix system calls to read and write to various filesystems locally and across the network. However, that interface is  complicated for developers to learn from the documentation, due to the lack of examples and the similarity between parts of the API. This directs developers to ask their questions on questions and answers communities like Stack Overflow. We study the questions asked about the Linux filesystem API on Stack Overflow, and demonstrate that it is a reliable source of information on that API.
  We also show that the community is still engaged in questions and discussions about Linux filesystem APIs, even after about 30 years from its birth.
  In addition, we quantitatively study which keywords are the most common in questions are asked about the APIs, and  examine which of filesystem APIs are likely to be asked about together, indicating codependency or confusion.
